== Unit Testing ==
Unit testing is a requirement for proper test-driven development. To learn how to utilize the tools Qt and the SDK make available for this, see [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Testing/QML|this page]].

== Functional testing ==
For functional testing you can utilize the autopilot tool. Originally developed for the testing unity, autopilot has become a useful tool for functionally testing many different types of applications; including QML! [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Testing/Autopilot|See this page]] for more information on how to [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Testing/Autopilot|get started using autopilot]].
