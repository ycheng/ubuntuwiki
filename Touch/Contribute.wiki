Contribute to development of Ubuntu on mobile devices. Join us and be part of the revolution! 

If you want to port the Ubuntu for Phones & Tablets to other devices than those currently supported, be sure to check out our [[Touch/Porting|Porting guide]].

The following sections describe how to the code and infrastructure for Ubuntu for Phones & Tablets is currently published and used.

= Code overview =

Ubuntu Touch is currently built from the Ubuntu archive combined with some modified and new packages and some Android components to enable specific devices. In the past we promoted developer images to be 'stable' in sync with Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) and 14.04 (Trusty Tahr). Now the phone images have there own release cycle, culminating in an OTA update for all devices on the stable channel.

== Source code ==

Ubuntu for Phones & Tablets currently consists of a collection of open source projects in Launchpad and an Android layer. 

=== Ubuntu code ===

Most Ubuntu packages are unmodified, and their source code is found directly in the Ubuntu archive.  Contributions should [[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/fixing-a-bug.html|follow the usual patch submission guidelines for these packages]].

New software and packages are developed in using the [[https://help.launchpad.net/Code|Bazaar]] distributed version control system, in various [[https://launchpad.net/|Launchpad]] sub-projects.

To hack on these ''system apps'', you can pick the one you're interested in from [[Touch/Components|the list]], check out the code using Bazaar and submit a merge proposal in Launchpad. You may be especially interested in the [[Touch/CoreApps|core apps]].

=== Android layer ===

You can find all the needed Android code on the [[https://code-review.phablet.ubuntu.com/#/admin/projects/|Android layer's public git repositories]]. This is essentially a mirror of the CyanogenMod, but containing only the needed low level services used by Android (e.g. no Dalvik at all).

A porting guide for adapting this layer to other devices can be found at [[Touch/Porting|Porting guide]].

== Image building ==

=== Building and publishing Ubuntu images ===

Images are currently built in the Canonical data center. Full builds are published on `cdimage.ubuntu.com`.

The images are built from an internal Jenkins instance and are automatically copied to cdimage.ubuntu.com. 

If you have any questions about the images or would like to get images added, [[Touch/GetHelp|get in touch with us]].

The [[Touch/Porting|Porting Guide]] contains more information about this.

= How to report bugs =

We expect a large amount of feedback and will do our best to go through it!

/!\ Bugs should be filed in the individual affected packages.

See [[Touch/Bugs]] for more information and help on filing.
